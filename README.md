# Albania-s-food-security-prediction
How can we predict the prevalence of undernourishment in Albania using **data science methods and python** to thereby offer a comprehensive evaluation of the country's food security status, utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing economic factors, environmental factors, agricultural dynamics and  sociopolitical factors? Is it increasing or decreasing over the years? What is the most contributing factor?

### Overview of the problem
Food security is not just about having enough food; it's about ensuring that all people have consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for an active and healthy life. In Albania, this is a multifaceted challenge influenced by various factors, including agricultural productivity, economic stability, environmental conditions, and sociopolitical dynamics.

The country's food security is intricately linked to its ability to produce food locally, manage environmental resources, sustain economic growth, and maintain sociopolitical stability. These diverse elements form the backbone of our study."

### Problem Statement
"Our project aims to predict the prevalence of undernourishment in Albania, offering a comprehensive evaluation of the country's food security status. We're using a detailed dataset that encapsulates a wide range of factors, from economic and environmental conditions to agricultural dynamics and sociopolitical indicators. By examining these diverse elements, we can gain a holistic understanding of the factors that contribute to food security in Albania and identify key areas for intervention and improvement."

In the case of Albania, we're exploring how these aspects are influenced by local and global factors such as agricultural productivity, climate change, economic policies, and political stability. Our predictive model is designed to unravel these complex interactions and provide insights into how Albania can strengthen food security and which factor to tackle."

### Evaluation Metrics and Methods
##### Metrics:
for each model and iterations we used these metric to evaluate and analyses the performance of the model.

r-squared value:Proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The closer to 1 the better (but cannot be too close 1.00) 

mse value: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, i.e., the average squared difference between the estimated values and actual value. The lower the better (but cannot be too close to 0.00 )

##### Testing:

Cross validation case:Assessing how the statistical analysis generalizes to an independent dataset (dividing into subsets with k-folds). The closer the average mse to the train and test cases the better.
